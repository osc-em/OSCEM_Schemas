# OSCEM schemas
Schema for the Open Standards Community for Electron Microscopy (OSC-EM): Defining the electron microscopy-related fields required by the OSCEM standard.

## Overview
The OSCEM schemas are designed to standardize metadata for electron microscopy, structured modularly to accommodate various methods and use cases. Each module can represent different aspects of an experiment, such as "sample", "instrument", and "author." These modules are combined into a comprehensive schema that defines the required metadata for a specific method. This standard ensures consistency in data collection, facilitates data validation, and enhances comparability between datasets.

To increase compatibility with different formats, we utilize LinkML, which allows us to export the schema to widely used formats.

## Currently implemented methods
### Life sciences:
- **cryoEM**:
  - Single particle analysis
  - Tomography:
    - Subtomogram averaging
    - Cellular tomography
    - Environmental tomography

## Usage
All schemas are available in YAML format under the directory src/oscem_schemas/schema. Files prefixed with oscem_* refer to collections of subschemas, such as those for single particle analysis. Schemas with more specific names, like "instrument," represent individual subschemas that can be modularly incorporated into oscem_* schemas. By using LinkML generator functions, these schemas can be exported to various formats such as JSON Schema, JSON-LD, OWL, CSV and RDF. For metadata validation, we recommend using the JSON Schema versions.

## Note
Current versions are a work in progress, details might change.

## Repository Structure

* [examples/](examples/) - example data
* [project/](project/) - project files (do not edit these)
* [src/](src/) - source files (edit these)
  * [oscem_schemas](src/oscem_schemas)
    * [schema](src/oscem_schemas/schema) -- LinkML schema
      (edit this)
    * [datamodel](src/oscem_schemas/datamodel) -- generated
      Python datamodel
* [tests/](tests/) - Python tests

## Developer Documentation

<details>
Use the `make` command to generate project artifacts:

* `make setup`: one-time setup
* `make all`: make everything
* `make deploy`: deploys site
* `make test`: run tests and linting
* `make serve`: run docs locally on http://127.0.0.1:8000/oscem-schemas/
* `make clean` : remove generated files

</details>

Some adaptations were made to the cookiecutter to allow for multiple "main" schemas in the repository:

* instead of targeting a single root schema, the cookiecutter searches for schemas following the oscem_schemas_$.yaml pattern in src/oscem_schemas/schema/ where $ corresponds to the name of your schema.
* generates an overall documentation webpage, with subpages for each of the individual schemas. If you add a new schema its subpage will be added automatically BUT you need to add a general description and an apropriate link in perm_docs/index.md to make it appear in the overall index page!
* example data for testing goes into src/data/examples/ and follows the pattern example_valid_$.yaml where $ corresponds to the same schema name as oscem_schemas_$.yaml.
* All LinkML output files for each of the schemas will still be generated into the projects directory, with a subfolder per schema e.g. projects/spa/
* The vast majority of changes were made in the Makefile in order to have it work on multiple schemas instead of one, so if there are issues, check there first.
