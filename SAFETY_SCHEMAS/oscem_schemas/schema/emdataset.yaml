### This is the archetype for all oscem schemas - 
### import this as your top level and fill accordingly with subschemas.
### Finally add your schema to oscem_schemas.yaml as import and into its EMDatasetUnion class
### DO NOT MAKE ANY CLASS BUT THE EMDATASET IN YOUR SCHEMA, DO NOT REDEFINE SLOTS - ONLY SLOT_USAGE
### -- otherwise it will clash if imported into another schema -- all definitions need to be in subschemas
